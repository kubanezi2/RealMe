why most directories here contains just one files? is it bad?


we know, most of the directories here contains only one file and it's intentional because this directory structure has to match with the structure we've on api server(php one) even thou server has more files in each directory than we've here. we are generating most of the files you see here for client based on what we've on server and that's why we are leaving this directory structure as it as for the sake of bug free code generation.
